    Most businesses don’t fail because of a bad product — they struggle because of
    <span class="highlight">unclear direction, unhealthy culture, and inconsistent systems</span>.

  <p>
    A trusted outside advisor brings what the internal team often cannot:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear, objective perspective</li>
    <li>Proven frameworks and tools</li>
    <li>Leadership and communication expertise</li>
    <li>Systems that support consistency and profit</li>
    <li>Accountability that turns ideas into action</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My mission with GE Coaching and Consulting is simple:
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    Help leaders build healthy businesses that grow, thrive, and last.

  <p>
    I specialize in guiding companies through organizational challenges, culture resets,
    leadership development, and scaling strategies — whether you’re stabilizing, rebuilding,
    or preparing for the next level.

    <h2 class="page-title">The G.R.O.W.T.H. Business Transformation Framework™</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    The G.R.O.W.T.H. Framework is a six-part process that helps businesses move from reaction and chaos
    to clarity, health, and sustainable growth.
  </p>

  <h3>G — Gain Clarity</h3>
  <p>
    We begin with a full diagnostic of your leadership, culture, systems, and financial health to
    identify what’s really going on beneath the surface.
  </p>

  <h3>R — Repair Relationships & Culture</h3>
  <p>
    We address unresolved tension, misalignment, and communication gaps so your team can trust, collaborate,
    and move in the same direction.
  </p>

  <h3>O — Organize Systems</h3>
  <p>
    We review and strengthen the systems that create consistency: workflow, onboarding, customer experience,
    sales processes, and operational rhythm.
  </p>

  <h3>W — Work the Plan</h3>
  <p>
    Together we build a clear, simple plan with quarterly goals, monthly milestones, and weekly actions
    so everyone knows what winning looks like.
  </p>

  <h3>T — Track & Optimize</h3>
  <p>
    We establish key metrics and feedback loops so you can see what’s working, adjust quickly,
    and avoid sliding back into old patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>H — High-Level Scaling</h3>
  <p>
    Once the foundation is healthy, we support you in growing the business through new revenue opportunities,
    leadership development, and strategic expansion.
